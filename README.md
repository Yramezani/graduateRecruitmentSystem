# graduateRecruitmentSystem
develop a Graduate Recruitment (GradRec) system that will enable faculty members to advertise Masters/PhD positions, provide information about their research projects and the availability of financial aid, and specify the required skills/background of the applicants. Prospective students, after registering, will provide the GradRec system with relevant information about their education, research interests, work experience, intended start date, need for financial support, etc. The system will match suitable candidates to supervisors and/or research projects. A channel of communication will then be established between both sides. The GradRec system will enable supervisors to make formal admission offer and students to accept (or decline) the offer. Program of Studies will be set up for the student and his/her progress will be monitored till the completion of the degree.
